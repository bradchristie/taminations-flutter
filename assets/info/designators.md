# Selecting Dancers

* **Boys / Girls**
* **Beaus / Belles** - follows the A-1 definition: dancers with partner on the right are Beaus, 
dancers with partner on the left are Belles
* **Leaders / Trailers** 
* **Ends / Centers / Very Centers** - follows the Callerlab definition, including that for tidal formations.
* **Facing Dancers** - Pairs of dancers facing each other
* **Facing In / Out** - from the center of the square.  You can also enter it as "Those Facing In", or "Dancers Facing In", or combine with another selector like "Boys Facing In".
* **Outer 2/4/6, Center 2/4/6** - according to distance from the center of the set.  
  Note that for tidal formations, Centers is not the same as Center 4.
* **Center / Middle / Outside Diamond** - Selects specified diamond from formations with
  a center wave or line of 4 or 6.  Center and Outside Diamond can also be used with thars.
* **Heads / Sides** - in a squared set, refers to dancers in those positions.
Otherwise, the original heads or sides.
* **Couples / Waves** - dancers that are couples (facing the same direction),
  or dancers in waves or mini-waves (facing opposite directions).  You can
  also say "Dancers in Waves" or "Wave Dancers".
* **Center Line / Wave or Diamond / Star of 4** - necessary to select center dancers in less common formations that have both lines and stars in the center.
* **Wave of 6**
* **Couple 1/2/3/4** - Select one specific couple to do a call, which will then produce an asymmetric formation.  For a squared set, this will select the couple on the respective spot on the floor.  For other formations, it will select the couple that started at that spot.  These formations have had only limited testing, so you are likely to find many calls that do not work.
