# Circle Rule

From an Infacing Circle of 8, if the caller names two adjacent dancers and their opposites and gives a call
that starts from Facing Couples, the dancers dance the call as if the circle has been changed into a Squared
Set, and follow the Squared Set Convention. Examples:

From a Squared Set: “Join Hands, Circle Left; Heads Up to the Middle and Back; Heads Square Thru 4”.

From a Squared Set: “Heads Half Sashay; All Circle Left; 4 Boys Spin the Top”.
