# Squared Set Convention

Calls that are defined as starting from Facing Dancers or Facing Couples are also proper starting from a
Squared Set. The caller must identify which pair of couples is active (for example, “Heads” or “Boys”).

The active dancers move forward into the center of the set and execute the call. If they end facing the same
walls as the inactive dancers, they will remain in the center (for example, “Heads Square Thru 4”, “Heads
Star Thru”, “Heads Touch 1/4”).

If the call ends with the active dancers not facing the same walls as the inactive dancers, then the active
dancers end back on Squared Set spots unless there is clear reason to remain in the center. (For example,
Dancers should return to Squared Set spots for “Head Ladies Chain”, “Heads Right and Left Thru”, “Heads
Pass Thru”, or “Heads Square Thru 3”.)

Because of the ending handhold, on the call “Heads Box the Gnat”, the Heads remain in the center and take
the next call. Usually the exact ending position is obvious from the next call (for example, “Heads Right and
Left Thru”, “Sides Right and Left Thru”), or doesn't matter because the next call continues the dance action
(for example, “Heads Pass Thru, Separate, Around 1 to a Line”).

Some callers who want the active dancers to remain in the center precede the call with a “Heads Move In”,
“Heads Move Forward”, or “Heads Move into the Center”. For example, “Heads Move In and Square Thru 3”
would have the Heads remain in the center instead of returning to Squared Set spots.

*Timing:* Moving into the center adds 2 beats to the timing for the move.

Note that the time needed to move out of the middle will often be blended into the final portion of the call (as
in “Right and Left Thru”, during the Courtesy Turn) or be overlapped with the start of the following call (as
in “Heads Right and Left Thru, Sides Right and Left Thru”)
