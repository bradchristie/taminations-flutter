    Each dancer turns 90 degrees, in place, to face the center of the line (i.e., turning toward the far end of the line) and starts walking forward, as necessary passing right shoulders with dancers from the other half of the line. For 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4, dancers stop at a Right-Hand Single 1/4 Tag, Right-Hand Box Circulate, and Right-Hand Single 3/4 Tag formation, respectively.

    If the centers start holding right hands, a flowing type of movement can be achieved by taking a slight step forward while turning toward the center of the line.

  <div class="comments"><b>Comments</b>
    <p>These are 4-dancer calls. From a General Line of 8, the phrase "Each Side" (or “Each Four”) is helpful but not required.</p>
    <p>From General Lines, 3/4 (or 1/4) Tag ends in a Right-Hand 3/4 (or 1/4) Tag formation because outside dancers move together to become a couple. See "Additional Detail: Dance Action: Square Breathing".</p>
    <p>The fraction is often given first because dancers may begin moving before the caller has said the entire call. "Tag the Line One-Quarter" is strongly discouraged because the call takes only three beats.</p>
    <p>Callers often abbreviate the fraction, using "Half" (or "Quarter") for "One-Half" (or "One-Quarter"). For emphasis, the full fraction can be used or "the Line" can be added, such as "One-Quarter Tag the Line".</p>
