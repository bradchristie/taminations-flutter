<h2>Triangle Formation</h2>
<p>A triangle is a formation of 3 dancers. One is the apex and the other two form the base. If the base
dancers are aligned in a general column, the triangle is called a tandem-based triangle. If the base
dancers are aligned in a general line, the triangle is called a wave-based triangle. In some triangles all 3
dancers may not be immediately adjacent to each other. Triangles are found as parts of a galaxy,
hourglass, twin diamonds and various other formations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Triangle Circulate</b>
From a triangle: Each dancer moves forward one position
along one of the circulate paths shown below:

</p>
<p>Teaching Hint: Every dancer has one shoulder toward the
  inside of the triangle. After Triangle Circulate, that same
  shoulder is still toward the center.
</p>
<p>Note: On Triangle Circulate from a T-boned triangle (base dancers are T-boned to each other), base dancers
  use their own starting position to determine whether to treat the triangle as tandem-based or wave-based,
  whereas apex dancers use the starting position of the spot to which they Circulate.</p>
<p>
<b>Inpoint/Inside/Outpoint/Outside Triangles</b>.
Various formations, including Twin Diamonds and Point-to-Point Diamonds, contain Triangles.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Inside Triangle</b>: The Center 6 form the Triangles.</p>

</p>

<p><b>Outside Triangle</b>: The Outside 6 form the Triangles.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="triangle_2a.png"/>
<img alt="" src="triangle_2b.png"/>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The footprints of twin diamonds, with the outside 4 in tandem, contain additional Triangles. Each of
these triangles has one point as the apex and two of the center 4 as the base.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Inpoint Triangle</b>:Each point facing in is an apex.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="triangle_3a.png"/>
<img alt="" src="triangle_3b.png"/>
</p>

<p><b>Outpoint Triangle</b>: Each point facing out is an apex.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="" src="triangle_4a.png"/>
<img alt="" src="triangle_4b.png"/>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Tandem-based/Wave-based Triangles</b><br/>
Various formations, especially a Galaxy, contain triangles that may be
identified by the formation of their “base”. A wave-based triangle has
the dancers in the base usually in a mini-wave (also possible: a
couple). A tandem-based triangle has the dancers in the base usually in
a tandem (also possible: facing or back-to-back dancers).</p>
