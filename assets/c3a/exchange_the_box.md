# Exchange the Boxes / Triangles

To perform an "Exchange", dancers in two adjacent similar
formations circulate, first in their own formation, and then in the
adjacent formation. The total number of circulates for a full
Exchange is equal to the number of positions in a single formation of
that type. Dancers circulate in their own formation until they reach
their "exchange point", which is the point in their normal circulate
path when they are closest to, but not facing away from, the center
of the overall formation. Their next circulate is into the other
formation, crossing over to the spot in that formation which
corresponds to the one where they would have gone for a normal
circulate. Once they have crossed over into the other formation, they
stay to the outside of any dancers who are still circulating in their
original formation, but finish at the end of the call on the
footprints of the original formation when possible.
## Exchange the Boxes
**Parts:** 4  


From a 2x4 formation: Do a total of four Split Circulates
except that when you reach your exchange point (when you are an
in-facing Center) do your next Circulate to the diagonal opposite
position (crossing over into the other Box). In most cases there will
be one Center from each Box who will lead the Exchange and everyone
else in their Box can follow them. A full exchange ends in a 2x4
formation; Mini-Wave Boxes end in opposite-handed Mini-Wave Boxes.

## Exchange the Triangles
**Parts:** 3  


From Twin Triangles: Do a total of three Triangle Circulates
except that when you reach your exchange point do your next Circulate
to the other Triangle. From Apex-to-Apex Triangles, the exchange
point is the apex and this Circulate is an Interlocked Triangle
Circulate; from Base-to-Base Triangles, the exchange point is when
you are a base facing into the center of the set and this Circulate
is to the diagonal opposite position. RH or LH Triangles end in
opposite-handed Triangles.
