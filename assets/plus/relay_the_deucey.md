Starting formation - Parallel Ocean Waves.


All Circulates in this definition refer to the Original
Circulate path established by the ends of the original ocean
waves. No dancer ever stops moving during this call; the pauses
written into the definition (i.e., the action described as
"half-circulate") are there for clarity of description
and for teaching purposes only.

***Each end and the adjacent center dancer turn one-half (180°).***

***The new centers of each ocean wave turn three-quarters
(270°), while the others half-circulate, forming a
six-person wave and two lonesome dancers.***

***The wave of six, working as 3 pairs, turns 180°, while the others
half-circulate.***

***In the wave, the center 4 turn 180°, while the other four dancers
half-circulate.***

***The wave of 6, again working as 3 pairs, turns 180°, while the
others half-circulate.***

***Finally, the center 4 of the wave turn ¾ (becoming the centers
of the new waves), while the outside 4 half-circulate to become
the ends of the final waves.***

STYLING:
Basic swing thru
styling is utilized for turning movements within the ocean wave
formations. Circulating dancers do the circulate action with arms in
natural dance position,
blending to hands up ocean wave formation at the conclusion of the
call.

Timing: 20
