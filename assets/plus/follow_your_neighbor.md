# Follow Your Neighbor

Starting formation - Box Circulate, Single 1/4 Tag. 

From a Box Circulate: While the Trailers Extend and Arm Turn 3/4, the Leaders move forward in a tight
three quarter (270 degree) circle toward their partner to finish as ends of an ocean wave. Follow Your
Neighbor cannot be fractionalized.

From a Single 1/4 Tag: All dancers do the Trailers part (Extend and Arm Turn 3/4).

From a Right-Hand Box Circulate, Follow Your Neighbor ends in a Left-Hand Wave. From a Right-Hand
Single 1/4 Tag, Follow Your Neighbor ends in a Right-Hand Wave

STYLING: Those who Arm Turn 3/4 use a forearm grip,
blending at the end of the call into the usual handhold for an ocean wave.

Timing: 6
