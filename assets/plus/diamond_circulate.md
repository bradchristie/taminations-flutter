# Diamond Circulate

Starting formation - Any Diamond. 

Each dancer moves forward to the next position in his diamond, changing his original
facing direction one-quarter (90°) toward the center of the diamond. Points become
centers, and vice versa. If the call is directed to facing diamonds, all must pass right
shoulders. 

STYLING: It is important that dancers maintain diamond formation as they move diagonally from one position to the next. Center dancers of diamond blend into  hands up position as in ocean wave. Dancers at the points maintain arms in  natural dance position. Ladies may utilize  skirt work.

Timing: 3
