# Flip the Diamond

Starting formation - Any Diamond. 

The centers of the diamond do a [Diamond Circulate](diamond_circulate.md) to the next position in their
diamond, while the points [Run](../b2/run.md) ("Flip" 180°) into the nearest center
position and join hands to become the centers of the forming wave or line. When
"flipping" a facing diamond, the points always take the inside path, and the
centers always take the outside path. 

STYLING: From a normal diamond formation, all dancers blend into  hands up position as required for ocean wave basic. If the starting formation is a facing diamond, all dancers blend into a  couple handhold.

Timing: 3
