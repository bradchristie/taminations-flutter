# Fan the Top

Starting formation - ocean wave or two-faced lines. The centers
of the line or wave turn three quarters (270°) while the outside dancers move forward in a
quarter circle. The ending formation is at right angles to the starting formation. Centers
remain centers and ends remain ends. 

STYLING: Center dancers use hands-up position and styling similar to that of  swing thru. End dancers' arms are in natural dance position and hands are ready to assume appropriate position for the next call.

Timing: 4
