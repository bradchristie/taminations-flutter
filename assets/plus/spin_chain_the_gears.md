# Spin Chain the Gears

Starting formation: Ocean Waves. 

***Each end and the adjacent center Turn 1/2.***
***New centers Turn 3/4 to form a center Ocean Wave
and the ends Flip In (180 degree inward turn similar to Ends Run).*** 
***Very Centers Turn 1/2.*** 
***Each half of the square forms a four-hand Star (a “gear”)
and turns it 3/4.***
***Very Centers Turn 1/2***
***Those in the center Ocean Wave Turn 3/4
while the other four dancers Flip Out
(180 degree outward turn similar to Centers Run).***
The call ends in waves with the same handedness and in
the same location as the original waves.

STYLING: Ocean wave and star turns use standard styling.

As the Centers Turn 3/4 at the beginning of the call,
the other dancers pause slightly and then,
as they Flip In, they bring the other hand up to immediately join the forming star.

TIMING: 24

COMMENTS: The [Facing Couples Rule](../b2/facing_couples_rule.md) applies to this call.

The 3/4 fraction to turn the star can be modified by the caller,
in which case different dancers
will be the Very Centers for the Turn 1/2.
