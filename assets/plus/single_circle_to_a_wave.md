# Single Circle to a Wave

Starting formation - Facing dancers. 

Facing dancers join both hands with each other and [ Circle Left](../b1/circle.md) halfway. Without
stopping, they drop hands with each other and individually [ Veer
Left](../b1/veer.md), blending into a
right-hand mini-wave. If the caller directs "Single Circle 3/4 to a Wave",
facing dancers join both hands with each other and [Circle
Left](../b1/circle.md) 3/4, then continue to
execute the rest of the call as above. 

STYLING: In circling, the two dancers are slightly offset to the left so that their
dance partner in the circle is more to their right than in front of them. Use smooth dance
step, not buzz. When joining hands for circle, gents turn palms up, ladies palms down.
Arms are bent comfortably at the elbows. Exert a small amount of pressure while circling.
Blend into a  hands up ocean wave position.

Timing: 4
