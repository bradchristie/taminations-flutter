# Dixie Grand

Starting formation - Dixie Grand Circle, Double Pass Thru, Quarter
Tag, or any formation
where at least two dancers can start. 

***Those who can, start the call by joining right hands
with the facing dancer and pulling by.***
***Each dancer moves ahead around the circle
and gives a left hand to the next, pulling by,***
***and a right hand to the next, pulling by.***
Regardless of the starting
formation, as the movement progresses, the formation converts to a circle. 

STYLING: Styling is similar to the description for the basic  right and left grand. Dancers use handshake hold for alternating  pull by movements, releasing hands as dancers pass each other. Skirt work is not recommended.

Timing: 6
