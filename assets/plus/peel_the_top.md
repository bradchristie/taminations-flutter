# Peel the Top

Starting formation - box circulate or Z-Formation. 

The lead dancers [Peel Off](peel_off.md) as the trailing dancers step straight forward and take
adjacent hands; everyone then does a [Fan the Top](fan_the_top.md). 

STYLING: Lead dancers have arms in  natural dance position and adjust hands to appropriate position for next call. It is important that dancers move slightly forward before starting the "peeling" motion. Trailing dancers use  hands up position and styling as described in the basic  Swing Thru.

Timing: 6
